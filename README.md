# olympics-medals

- Use the medal data in olympics_2008_medalists.json to rank countries by total medals won in descending order.
- Display the total medal count per country, as well as total gold, silver and bronze per country.
- It should filter the countries by gold, silver, or bronze medals.
- Style it as you see fit. Feel free to be creative.
- Complete this task as if you intend shipping it to production. Tests are required.
