Web app to display the olympics medals by countries in a nice way.

### Aims:

Write a web application which:

* Uses the medal data in olympics_2008_medalists.json to rank countries by total medals won in descending order.
* Displays the total medal count per country, as well as total gold, silver and bronze per country.
* It should filter the countries by gold, silver, or bronze medals.
* Style it as you see fit. Feel free to be creative.
* Complete this task as if you intend shipping it to production. Tests are required.
